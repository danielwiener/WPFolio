	TODO make images with line borders, something plain but nice
	TODO make some more background images, with gradients, something simple, but different to give people an idea. and make default white
	TODO don't forget you are in git branch master - oops I was supposed to be in custom header 
	TODO wrap the header image function if an "if exists"
	TODO Change theme options so they don't apply to the title. Title done through header.
	TODO Make default color on header options the same as the present theme options
	TODO Make header thumbnails the same size
	TODO Look up what adds header text color, maybe add to theme options. - and now I got rid of header text... that might be better for this since it needs to be backward compatible and you can handle it in the theme options.
